# 🧠 JavaScript Advanced Concepts & Interview Preparation

This repository is a complete roadmap and hands-on guide to mastering advanced JavaScript concepts for technical interviews and real-world problem solving. It includes deep explanations, visual examples, and practical code implementations of core JS mechanisms and interview-level challenges.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- **Call Stack** — how JavaScript executes functions one by one
- **Task Queue & Microtask Queue** — understanding event order and async flow
- **Event Loop** — how JS handles concurrency and asynchronous callbacks
- **Web APIs** — browser-provided features like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, `DOM`, etc.
- **Objects & ES6+ Features** — destructuring, spread, rest, classes, etc.
- **Prototypes & Prototypal Inheritance** — internal links and behavior chaining
- **Building Your Own Promise** — custom Promise implementation with states
- **Proxy & Reflect** — intercepting and controlling object behavior
- **Event Emitter** — build your own publish-subscribe pattern from scratch
- **Task Scheduling** — deep dive into async scheduling, priority, and queues
- **Debounce & Throttle** — optimize performance for real-time event handling
- **Advanced Interview Questions** — tricky, logic-based JS questions with explanations

## 🧩 Goal

To build a **strong conceptual and practical foundation** in JavaScript —  
enough to **crack top-tier interviews** and **master real-world asynchronous behavior**.

## 📘 Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for testing async patterns)
- Markdown notes + code examples

---

## 💡 Future Additions

- Custom implementations of JS internals
- Browser vs Node.js event loop comparison
- Memory management & garbage collection
- Hands-on coding exercises and interview prep sheets
